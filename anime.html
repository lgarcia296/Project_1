        <p>Naruto is one of my favorite anime, and it ranks third because I enjoy the fights and the story it tells. It also led me to explore other similar anime.</p>

      <h3>#1</h3>
      <div>
        <img src="images/yugioh.jpg" alt="Yu-Gi-Oh series logo">
        <p>Yu-Gi-Oh takes the number one spot because I started watching and playing it in 4th grade. I still buy Yu-Gi-Oh cards and play to this day, keeping over 100 cards as a cherished memory.</p>
