    <h1>My Favorite Animes</h1>
	
	<p>I first started watching 
	</p>
	
	<div>
	  <p>This drawing was inspired by the character Akame from the anime Akame ga kill and is one</p>
	  <p>of my favorite drawings that I have made. I chose a specific scene that I liked and did</p>
	  <p>my best to draw it and shade it properly.</p>
	</div>
	
	<h2>Drawing 2</h2>
	
	<div>
	  <p>I took inspiration for this drawing from the anime classroom of the elite. The character I drew</p> 
	  <p>is the main character Ajanokoji, he portrayed to be smart and composed which is why he is my favorite</p>
	  <p>charcter of the anime. I used an image I found on google to use as reference for his pose.</P> 
	</div>
	
	<h3>Drawing 3</h3>
	
	<div>
	  <p>This drawing is from the anime Sephra of the end anime and the character that I drew</p>
	  <p>Mikaela. The anime is about vampires and this charcter was turned into a vampire, and is one of my</p> 
	  <p>favorite charcters in the show.</P>
